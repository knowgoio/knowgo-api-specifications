  title: KnowGo Adaptation API
  description: |
    The KnowGo Adaptation API defines the endpoints used by the KnowGo backend
    to support run-time reconfiguration, monitoring, and notification of
    adaptation events, both on the backend as a whole, as well as on individual
    users.

    A pub/sub interface for notifications is further provided, providing
    adaptation notifications via registered REST API callbacks.

    This work has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020
    research and innovation programme under grant agreements No. 731678 and
    No. 825480.

      description: |
        Sets the adaptation scheme used by the backend. New users of the
        system will automatically inherit this adaptation scheme, while users
        with a pre-existing adaptation scheme that is weaker than the proposed
        server adaptation will be automatically migrated during the course of
        carrying out the server adaptation. Users that have a more restrictive
        adaptation scheme in place will be unaffected by changes to the server
        adaptation.

        Server adaptation (and any adaptation of affected users) is carried
        out asynchronously, with each user adaptation and the final server
        adaptation status being reported to the completion callback, if
        provided.
